    <p> 1.1 <b><u>Fast</u></b> and efficient communication.  Employees are able to do huge amounts of calculations compared with paperwork and calculators. At least that's the theory. <br>
</p>
    <p>1.2 You need internet connection to establish e-mail communication.  Also good telephone communication.  Knowledge of programming languages, software applications.  Secretarial staff need Word and probably Excel.  Stores need a database.  However paperwork systems may be just as efficient.<br>
</p>
    <p>1.3 Planning a website needs decisions on style and content.  This includes print size and colours, positioning of imagees.<br>
</p>
    <p>1.4 <i>Risk from viruses</i> and not saving information.  People taking data sticks and laptops out of the office and leaving them on trains.  Also the complexity of computing is itself a problem for programmers, users and customers .
    </p>
    <p>1.5 You would need to take advice from online recommendations or outside consultancy.<br>
</p>
    <p>1.6 We used the VS coding environment to learn coding skills.  E-mail is useful for everyday communication,  Trello I haven't used yet.  Forums are useful, but the industry itself should keep things simple.<br>
