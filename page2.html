   <h1>page 2</h1> 
   2.1 I used the Visual Studio to create the webpage.  I used Yahoo
</body>to source images, and 3 Schools to source some useful HTML code.<br>
2.2 The Visual Studio was satisffactory for creating the Webpage.  I made notes on paper, then transferring to Visual Studio.<br>
2.3  It's ok, it has images and a link.  It lacks written text, especially to ezplain images. The general body of the text looks good.<br>
2.4  It needs text to add to images.  Images need to be bigger/smaller as needed. <br>


<u>Unit 1 Outcome 3</u><br>

3.1  I am still learning the various websites, so navigating aroiund pages is not alwuays straight forward.<br>  Choice of IT tools is obviously important.<br>
3.2  I need more practice,which should lead to a better product.<br>
3.3  To be more productive I would need to study procedures, practice them, and commit to memory. Not sure<br> working as a team always works, especially  when participants want to do their own thing.  But nany hands do make light work
